# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials "JJ" to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement, or if/else, allows preset decisions to occur.

Researched answer: Conditional statements are flowchart-like instructions that produce a new output(s) within the code.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a version control; GitHub is a git-using platform.

Researched answer: Git (local repo) is a free, open-source version control system, while GitHub (remote repo) is the largest online platform using git that allows developers to share and store code and test and deploy apps.


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An index is an array element's location. A value is an array element's content.

Researched answer: An index is an address-like sequential data accessible within an array, starting with a zero element and separated by a comma. A value is the content of each element.


3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

 Your answer: An array is a list of strings and numbers. A string is a textform in quotation marks. An array can have one or more strings, be separated by a comma as an array element, and both an array and string are pivotal in Javascript. A string, however, cannot be an array or directly altered outside of a function, such as via the toUpperCase method. 

Researched answer: An array groups things (data) together like a container of Javascript-friendly information (datatypes). Arrays and strings are essential programming data structures and hold value. But while arrays store and manipulate sets of datatypes and are contained by brackets, strings represent one storable and manipulatable datatype, text, which is contained by double or single quotes.


4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher-order Functions: Array methods that use functions as arguments and return functions as results.

2. Jest: A Facebook-created framework designed to simplify the process of testing a codebase.

3. Objects: A collection of paired data values, or even a containter of actions (functions) known as methods.
